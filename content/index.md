I'm Stuart. This is my little internet garden. 

I like to code, I like to [[Digital Gardening|write]], and I love building, using, and evangelising [[Beautiful Software|beautiful software]]. The things written here are written mostly for me, but a little bit as my window to the outside world. 

I'm currently VP of Product at [[Things/Spot Health|Spot Health]] where I'm helping to make diagnostic testing more affordable. 

Looking for somewhere to start? How about taking a look at [[Thoughts/index|some of my recent thoughts]].
