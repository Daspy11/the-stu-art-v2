# Spot Health

[Spot](https://spotdx.com) is a diagnostics-as-a-service startup that helps makes diagnostics cheaper and faster. It was funded by [[./y combinator|Y Combinator]] in the W22 batch. 

Spot assembles its own at-home collection kits and aggregates multiple labs for testing. The result is moving faster, cheaper testing, and a much bigger testing menu than competitors.

I started working at Spot in September 2022 as their VP of Product after moving on from my last startup, [[./simple construction software|Simple Construction Software]]. 

Having watched Spot beat out a lot of its competitors on deals, I think what makes Spot win is very tight operational excellence which results in unparalleled speed and quality. If Spot keeps winning, it's because that culture was maintained, and if it stops winning it's because it died or someone else did it better.
