For [[./recipe|recipes]] you can still make when you have no energy. The defining qualities of a lazy recipe are that:

1. It can be cooked end-to-end in 15 minutes or less.
2. Minimal washing up, utensils and one pot at most.
3. Either requires no ingredients with an extremely short shelf life, or if it does, uses the whole packet so you don't have to worry about wasting food.
