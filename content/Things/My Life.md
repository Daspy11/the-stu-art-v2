# A timeline of my life to date

**June 10, 2001** - I am born in [Chelmsford, Essex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelmsford).

**October 2003** - After the [dot-com crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) led to the [near-bankruptcy of Marconi](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/aug/29/uknews), where my father worked, we moved to [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) for my father's new job.

**November 2004** - My family returns to England, and we begin renting in [Lee-on-the-Solent, Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-on-the-Solent), a small seaside town on the south coast with a population of around 7,000.

**July 2006** - My parents buy a home in [Fareham, Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fareham) where I would spend the rest of my childhood.

**September 2006** - Now 5 years old, I begin attending [Meoncross School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meoncross_School), a small, local independent school. Around this time, I am diagnosed with [dyspraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder) which makes many things harder, including writing and sports.

**September 2008** - I move from Meoncross to Harrison Primary School, a state comprehensive school a few minutes from my home. 

**September 2012** - After finishing year 6, I start secondary education at [Cams Hill School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cams_Hill_School).

**September 2017** - After finishing year 11, I begin my A-levels in mathematics, further mathematics, and computer science at [Peter Symonds College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Symonds_College) in Winchester. I do not look back on this time fondly - my two years of sixth-form college were miserable and I was very unhappy.

**January 2019** - At 17, while still studying at Peter Symonds, my team is a finalist in [MIT Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/), a programming competition hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I take home half of $1250, my share of the winnings.

**September 2019** - I scrape through my A-levels, earning an underwhelming B in mathematics, B in computer science, and D in further mathematics. Consequently, I was [[./Failure CV|rejected]] from my first choice university - [Loughborough University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University). My second choice, [Cardiff University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_University), accepted me to study computer science. Also in September, I founded [[./Wutzu|Wutzu]], and would begin work on it during my first year of study.

**January 2020** - Someone I met on a dating app invited me to attend Cardiff's [[./Debating|debating]] society. I'd been rather isolated in my first semester as a result of long hours spent working on [[./Wutzu|Wutzu]]. I decided to attend, and made fast friends with the odd group of eclectic nerds I met there. 

**March 2020** - Wutzu launches just as the COVID-19 pandemic hits the country and all students are told to return home.

**May 2020** - I move to London following Wutzu's first angel investment.

**September 2020** - Wutzu struggles to compete with the sheer scale of growth capital being dumped into its competitors (literally [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/)) and has no fast road to profitability. I apply to [[./Entrepreneur First|Entrepreneur First]] and am [[./Failure CV|rejected]]. I instead start working at [[./Modernbanc|Modernbanc]], a [[YC|YC]]-backed fintech startup as its first employee.

**March 2020** - I leave Modernbanc to found another startup. I try to start a productised service for B2B landing page maintenance that I call PageKnight.

**August 2020** - I build some landing pages for fellow [[YC|Y Combinator]] companies, but PageKnight ultimately doesn't scale. I shut it down and re-apply to Entrepreneur First and this time am accepted.

**September 2021** - At Entrepreneur First I co-found [[./Simple Construction Software|Simple Construction Software]], a document workflow automation tool for the construction industry.

**January 2022** - Simple Construction Software passes Entrepreneur First's investment committee with strong recommendations to invest from all panelists.

**September 2022** - After a year of working on Simple Construction, we're not able to get the buy-in we need to achieve rollout on whole construction projects. We interview for [[./Y Combinator|Y Combinator]] but are [[rejected|rejected]]. I step away and begin leading the engineering team at [[./Spot Health|Spot Health]].
