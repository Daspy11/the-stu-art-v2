# Debating

Starting in January 2020, I've regularly competed in debating competitions in the British Parliamentary (BP) format. In BP format, 8 speakers are divided into four teams of two - opening government, opening opposition, closing government, and closing opposition. Motions are released only 15 minutes before the debate starts and internet research is not allowed. Although judging is subjective, there are relatively consistent and agreed upon metrics to judge debates.

This leads to an intense competitive experience which I find electrifying.

To "break" in a debating competition means to be a top performer in the "in-rounds" - a fixed number of rounds which all teams and judges participate in before they are cut down to around the top 25% of participants. Judges are selected based on feedback from other judges, from observation by experienced "chief adjudicators" who also set motions, and from feedback given by speakers based on the "oral adjudication" in which the chair judge of each debate explains how the panel reached their result. 

## My Breaks

As of the time of writing, I have **30 breaks** consisting of **16 judge breaks** and **15 speaking breaks**. I've ordered these approximately by prestige.
