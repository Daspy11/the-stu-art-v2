# Y Combinator

[Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com) (or YC to those in tech) is without measure the world's most successful startup accelerator. I've worked at two different Y Combinator funded companies in my life so far, [[./Spot-Health|Spot Health]] and [[./Modernbanc|Modernbanc]]. 

I have a lot of deep respect for the startup ecosystem that YC have pioneered. There's a unique fellowship amongst YC founders I've not seen anywhere else. Everyone buys in to this culture of helping other YC founders with things, and using products made by other YC companies. The name brand alone still holds incredible sway even as it scales into funding hundreds of companies per year.
