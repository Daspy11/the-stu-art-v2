# Baked bean shakshuka
Shakshuka is a North African dish consisting of eggs poached in a spiced tomato sauce. I find that this is a tastier alternative to a much simpler British classic - fried egg and beans on toast. It also creates very little mess and is actually quite good for you. This makes a hearty meal for one or a regular breakfast for 2.

When cooking this dish, it is useful to use a flat implement to stir the ingredients so it can be slid underneath the eggs to lift them without bursting the yolks.

## Ingredients needed
- 1 400g can of baked beans (Branston preferred)
- 3-4 eggs
- 1/2 of an onion
- 1 bell pepper
- 2 slices of bread
- Cumin
- Paprika

## Instructions
1. Dice the onion and bell pepper.
2. Add to frying pan with oil, cumin, and paprika. Splash with small amount of water to loosen if dry.
3. Empty tin of baked beans into pan. Add more paprika and cumin, and some black pepper. Stir to combine.
4. Create small holes in the beans and crack an egg into each. Use your cooking implement to push away the sauce further to allow the whites to spread out more and cook evenly.
5. Add a small amount of water to the dish and cover for a few minutes until the egg whites have cooked through. Try to refrain from removing the lid too often to check on them as it lets out the steam.
6. While the eggs are cooking, toast your bread.
7. Serve!
