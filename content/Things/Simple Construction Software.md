# Simple Construction Software

Simple Construction was my second startup, which I founded after leaving [[Things/Modernbanc|Modernbanc]] to join the next [[Things/Entrepreneur First|Entrepreneur First]] cohort in London. We ended up being funded by both EF and Brick & Mortar ventures, some great names in the industry. Sadly, construction was a tough nut to crack, and the incentive alignment was too tricky for us to solve in the time we had. 

After leaving Simple Construction Software, I started working at [[Things/Spot Health|Spot Health]].
