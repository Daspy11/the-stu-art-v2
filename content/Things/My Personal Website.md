# My Personal Website

This is a more technical description of how this website runs. For the philosophy, see [[Digital Gardening]].

I've tried out a lot of static site generators before. Previously I've rolled with [[https://docusaurus.io/|Docusaurus]], [[https://gohugo.io/ |Hugo]] with [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-blog-awesome/ |this theme]], and a few others. Since discovering [[Obsidian]] though, I've been writing all my notes there, and [[https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz |quartz]] absolutely blew me away with its ease of deployment, configurability, and performance.

The Github repo for this site is [[https://github.com/Daspy11/the-stu-art-v2 |here]], feel free to do whatever the hell you want with it.
