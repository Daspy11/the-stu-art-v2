# My Personal Website

This is a more technical description of how this website runs. For the philosophy, see [[./Digital Gardening|Digital Gardening]].

I've tried out a lot of static site generators before. Previously I've rolled with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [this theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-blog-awesome/), and a few others. Since discovering [[./Obsidian|Obsidian]] though, I've been writing all my notes there, and [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) absolutely blew me away with its ease of deployment, configurability, and performance.

The Github repo for this site is [here](https://github.com/Daspy11/the-stu-art-v2 |), feel free to do whatever the hell you want with it.
