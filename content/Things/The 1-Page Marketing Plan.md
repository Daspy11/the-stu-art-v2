# The 1-Page Marketing Plan
By Allan Dib

## Part 1: Market
- Uniqueness is everything, even if you work in an industry that seems boring and not differentiable.
- Don't try and be similar to competitors because they're probably doing a bad job as well.
- Price is the denominator when there is nothing else to compare.
- When choosing a market, consider PVP: personal enjoyment, value to market profitability. Score them out of 10.

**Elevator pitch template**
"You know {problem}, well what we do is {solution}, in fact, {proof}" 

## Part 2: Offer
- Talk to users, but know that they lie &- observe what they're really buying. 
- Use jargon of the market you're in. 
- 10-20% isn't interesting, look for bigger value adds. 
- Add bonuses that are worth more than the base product - eg infomercials doubling your order + some trinket. Come up with a plausible reason. 
- Add financing for high ticket products. 
- Outrageous guarantee - offer people their money back if you don't deliver. 
- Find a plausible excuse for scarcity. 
- Target pain/cures, prevention doesn't sell. 
- Buying is still emotional in a professional setting, people think emotive direct-response copy is inappropriate, but their marketing material is bland because they try to hard to be "professional". 
- Five biggest drivers of behaviour are fear, love, greed, guilt, pride. Use at least one. 

**Dealing with objections**
- Marketing needs to address the conversation going on in prospect's head. 
- Focusing only on positives leaves remaining anxiety. 
- Most anxieties are not voiced to salesp
- Tell people early on who you are not for to relax them and make them feel that your product is tailored for them. 

## Part 3: Advertising
- Hire consultants, don't DIY
- Choose obvious names, big vague brands have enough money that it doesn't matter. 
- CAC and LTV are the only metrics that matter, response rate and so on are just to calculate these. 
- Until you're sure of your numbers, aim to have the customer's first purchase cover CAC, but at scale, the front offer might be negative if you're sure of retention. 
- Social media is best used to drive traffic to your own assets, curating a following on-site is bad because the rules can change. 
-
