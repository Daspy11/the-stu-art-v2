# Incentives

An incentive is something that motivates an actor to do something. Two actors are said to have aligned incentives if they are most benefitted by the same action or outcome. 

The agency problem or principalâ€“agent problem occurs when one actor trusts another actor to take actions which are in their best interest. Humans tend to defect fairly reliably, and become increasingly likely to do so as the reward for doing so increases. 

The solution to the agency problem is incentive alignment which becomes increasingly difficult as the number of actors in a system increases. Incentive alignment is, in my opinion, the single biggest challenge for building effective systems of people, independent of size.

In my experience, surface level "incentive" arguments in conversations about macroeconomics are almost always naive to the point of being useless.
