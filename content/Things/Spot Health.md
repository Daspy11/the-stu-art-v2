# Spot Health

[Spot](https://spotdx.com) is a diagnostics-as-a-service startup that helps makes diagnostics cheaper and faster. It was funded by [[./Y Combinator|Y Combinator]] in the W22 batch. 

Spot assembles its own at-home collection kits and aggregates multiple labs for testing. The result is moving faster, cheaper testing, and a much bigger testing menu than competitors.

I started working at Spot in September 2022 as their VP of Product after moving on from my last startup, [[./Simple Construction Software|Simple Construction Software]]. 

Having watched Spot beat out a lot of its competitors on deals, I think what makes Spot win is very tight operational excellence which results in unparalleled speed and quality. If Spot keeps winning, it's because that culture was maintained, and if it stops winning it's because it died or someone else did it better. 

I think the biggest way Spot changed me was in my conception of the amount of work it's possible for one person to do effectively. Andrew and Doreen get an incredible amount done between the two of them while also raising a family, it genuinely blew my mind. 

I left Spot in 2024 as operations scaled in Ohio. As our manufacturing volume increased, it became less and less appropriate for me to be calling the shots on our internal tooling stack from another continent. I considered relocating to Cincinnati to jump on the rocket ship, but decided against it, and the writing was on the wall for the future of the business. In-person was going to be necessary for growth and that wasn't something I could do. I left to join [[Entrepreneur First]] for a second time.
