# Spot Health

[Spot](https://spotdx.com) is a diagnostics-as-a-service startup that helps makes diagnostics cheaper and faster. Spot assembles its own at-home collection kits and aggregates multiple labs. The result is that we move faster, are cheaper, and have a much bigger testing menu than our competitors.

I started working at Spot in September 2022 after moving on from my last startup, [[Things/Simple Construction Software|Simple Construction Software]]. It was funded by [[Things/Y Combinator|Y Combinator]] in the W22 batch.

Having watched Spot beat out a lot of its competitors on deals, my current hypothesis on what makes Spot win is very tight operational excellence. If Spot keeps winning, it's because that culture was maintained, and if it stops winning it's because someone else did it better.
