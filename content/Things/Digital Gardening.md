# Digital Gardening

I never quite understood the appeal of gardening. I'm a monster who kills a lot of plants, and having a lawn to mow regularly just seemed like taking on a pointless additional obligation for no real benefit.

In December 2021, I noticed that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse |metaverse article on Wikipedia]] was in a dire state of disrepair. I did a significant amount of work fixing up the article, and it brought me an odd sort of pleasure I didn't quite understand. Later, while exploring via the random article feature, I later stumbled across [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard/Archive_182#Louis_B._Rosenberg_%26_Zoe_Rosenberg_%26_Unanimous_A.I. |some sneaky paid reputation management work]] being done and did my best to fix it.

I didn't quite understand at the time why this was enjoyable, but I reflect on it as scratching the same kind of itch as gardening does for many people. 

Traditional meditation never quite hit the spot for me. Being alone with my thoughts for long periods of time seemed more scary than relaxing. Here I am alone with my thoughts, but those thoughts become a garden to reflect on, and a garden I can share with others at that.
