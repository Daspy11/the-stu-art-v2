# Buried Claims

A buried claim is a type of presupposition I originally saw discussed in [Aella's post titled "Frame Control" on LessWrong]() that I think is common but not often discussed.

> "Buried claims" - assertions that pressure you to jump through hoops to challenge the core. For example, "Everybody knows you’re sensitive"”" asks you to challenge *everybody knowing* before you can challenge *being sensitive.* If you angrily ask them to stop opening your door without knocking, they might say "Annoyance is understandable, it comes from a desire for privacy instilled into you by an isolated society." If you want to tell them your annoyance is important, now you have to argue *for* an isolated society, or that no it’s *not* caused by society.

In addition to the examples offered by Aella, I've previously written about [[Double-negation as framing|double negation]] as a form of claim burying.
