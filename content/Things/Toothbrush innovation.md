# Toothbrush innovation

What if you could brush every tooth at once and emerge from the cavity car wash with perfectly clean teeth in 20 seconds?

One of the ideas I explored while at [[./Entrepreneur First|Entrepreneur First]] in 2024 was building a diagnostic U-shaped toothbrush that could let you brush your teeth in 80% less time and simultaneously detect [[./Gum Disease|gum disease]].

Nearly half of American adults are affected by gum disease, and who wouldn't love to save 10 hours per year that is currently spent waving a stick in front your face?

The two largest two direct-to-consumer clear aligner companies both shut down[^1][^2] within a year of each other, and the main reason for that was [backlash](https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/) caused by lackluster eligibility screening stemming from high OpEx due to a dependency on in-person clinics.

If the humble toothbrush becomes the entry point for safe and standardised oral health screening, then the problem which has now killed two billion-dollar companies is solved.

U-shaped toothbrushes had been around for [nearly a decade](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amabrush/amabrush-worlds-first-automatic-toothbrush), but early silicon versions were about as useful as not brushing your teeth at all. Recent entrants [scrambled](https://y-brush.co/blogs/electric-toothbrush/nylon-or-silicone-who-cares-most-for-your-teeth) to distance themselves from these early versions. [Feno](https://feno.co/) and [Willo](https://willo.com/) are the two fastest-moving startups in the space right now.

Feno is an industrial-looking $300 diagnostic toothbrush that announced $7M in funding in September 2024, and launched just in time for Christmas.

Willo is a German company with $17M in funding founded all the way back in 2014 who've recently relaunched following a false start in 2021. Their product targets kids and uses a reservoir to circulate cleaning fluid.

Despite not being a U-shaped toothbrush, I must give an honorable mention to Suri - we spoke to a lot of people who owned one, and they pretty much all loved it. It's a very unassuming product to look at, but the fit amongst people concerned by how "dirty" (both literally and morally) mainstream electric toothbrushes were was evident.

To cut a long story short, the reason we didn't go ahead is a combination of [[./Gum Disease|the tech]] not quite being ready yet, learning a large number of customer interviews that individuals motivated to change their brushing habits are mostly poor adherents, and Feno being just too far ahead on R&D to compete for the relatively small biohacking market.

My favorite discovery of the whole experience was without a doubt the bizarre [Blizzbrush](https://youtu.be/cceO0rx2dqo?t=122) whose eclectic founder [angrily responds](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6494c99663ca0cbc3923de03) to negative comments on Trustpilot and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/aco59q/product_review_research_blizzident/egitqs0/?context=2). Despite looking totally absurd, it seems to actually work quite well! I'll leave the question of trapped bacteria and hygeine up to you.
