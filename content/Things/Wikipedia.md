# Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) is a big, magical website full of lots of information about everything. Writing things on Wikipedia was where I acquired my enjoyment of [[./Digital-Gardening|digital gardening]] back in 2022.

As of January 2024, I still edit Wikipedia from time to time. Aside from the obvious (that all of human knowledge can fit into your pocket a hundred times over), I think there are two ways that Wikipedia is a marvel:

1. Being editable by anyone and yet nevertheless managing to maintain order in the face of "anyone" including the most persistent of ideologues, vandals, laymen, and paid government [mooks](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks).
2. In the simplicity with which information is recorded while nevertheless encoding not just all kinds of information, but also two orders of change procedure - the procedures for changing content and the procedures for changing the change procedures - in a way that can reasonably be argued by the layman without resorting to bureaucracy. 

Above all else, I think Wikipedia's survival has come not necessarily as a result of the nobility of its mission or a force multiplier that backs it up, but through careful [[./Incentives|incentive]] alignment that makes disruption unproductive, unfun, and easily correctible. 

That resilience is underpinned by nerds motivated not by gamification or the hope of legacy, but I believe through the simple nerdish desire to improve the amount of correct information in the world.
