# Modernbanc

[Modernbanc](https://modernbanc.com) is a fintech company backed by [[Things/Y Combinator|Y Combinator]]. I worked as a software engineer for just under a year starting in August 2020 as my first real job following my departure from [[Things/Wutzu|Wutzu]].

Modernbanc was the first time I'd built something big in another format than one-man-army sprints. Working solo makes you resourceful and scrappy in a way I think is hard to match in a structured environment, but it also teaches you a lot of bad habits and a propensity for moving *too* fast and breaking *too* many things. 

I learned a lot in my relatively short time at Modernbanc - not just about software development and professionalism (being my first "real job"), but also about SOC-2 compliance, banking, and just how crazy the financial system is one layer under the surface.

I took what I learned at Modernbanc over to [[Things/Entrepreneur First|Entrepreneur First]] where I founded my second startup.
